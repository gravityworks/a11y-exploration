  <p>All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!</p>

  <p>Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. You've swallowed a planet! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.</p>
